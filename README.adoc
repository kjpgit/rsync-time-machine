Karl's unix/rsync time-machine script.
Maintains daily and monthly snapshots of a directory tree, hard linked to save
space when files don't change.
Inspired by http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/, but using
more robust coding practices.

See the link:rsync-time-machine.py[script] for full documentation.
